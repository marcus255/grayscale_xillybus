INFO: [Netlist 29-160] Cannot set property 'PIO_DIRECTION', because the property does not exist for objects of type 'pin'. [c:/Users/marcus255/Downloads/xillydemo_ise/xillinux-eval-zedboard-1.3c/vivado-essentials/vivado_system/ip/vivado_system_processing_system7_0_0/vivado_system_processing_system7_0_0.xdc:148]
Resolution: Modify the set_property command to apply the property on the correct object type. Since the property is being applied as a scoped constraint, ensure the proper connectivity of the object port objects can be translated into pin objects. This could be due to the insertion of IO Buffers between the top level terminal and cell pin. If the goal is to apply constraints that will migrate to top level ports it is required that IO Buffers manually be instanced.

Resolution: Modify the set_property command to apply the property on the correct object type. Since the property is being applied as a scoped constraint, ensure the proper connectivity of the object port objects can be translated into pin objects. This could be due to the insertion of IO Buffers between the top level terminal and cell pin. If the goal is to apply constraints that will migrate to top level ports it is required that IO Buffers manually be instanced.
